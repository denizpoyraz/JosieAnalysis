# JosieAnalysis

Codes inherited from Analysis_Josie repository: https://github.com/denizpoyraz/Analysis_Josie
Analysis_Josie had many unused, old-dated codes that need to be organized.

Explanation of the codes:

Josie0910_makeDF.py: reads 2009/2010 data and meta-data. Converts into a format which is analyzable for me.

Josie17_makeDF.py: The same as 0910, but the meta data is different for 2017 data.

MergeDF.py: general code to add DFs, like adding 2009 and 2010 and making one DF 

makeDF_Functions.py: Functions used by makeDF codes, Josie0910_makeDF and Josie17_makeDF
